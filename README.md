# Malignant-Lymphoma-Classification

Transfer Learning using Lymphoma Images

**Brief Description:** This project involved using deep learning techniques to classify images of three types of malignant lymphoma (CLL, FL, and MCL). I trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch and performed transfer learning with pre-existing models.

### Implementation (please see notebook for each task):
* Trained a CNN model from scratch for classification.
* Applied transfer learning techniques on pre-trained models, fine-tuning the last layers to adapt to our specific task.
